commit 0e63b5b41dec7b308fce23b5bc2676b4300312f2
Author: Kyle Pumbinner <kpumbinner@gtpd.gittown.gov>

    Crime scene report #956171

    Murder took place ten days ago, on July 14th. Coroner report says it was some time between 16:13 and
    19:37.

    According to the security guard that sat at the entrance to the factory, on the day of the murder no
    one came through the front door. So that leaves the back door, which requires an RFID card to open.

    With the help of the factory's IT department I managed to cherry-pick the relevant commits from the
    access log for all the electronically locked facilities on premise. They're on my personal
    'detectives/kpumbinner' branch. But they said the program doesn't have a search button... I'll have
    to sift through it to find who used "BACKDOOR_332". I put the log file in the evidence folder to
    look through later

$ git tag -l (for list)

Each street tag is tied to one specific commit.
$ git show street/beaconside
This will get you the commit you need.

$ git show 5e37024660b27211f54c09121d152ac519baa0ce 
Using the commit hash then shows it.
To find the ancestor of the commit you can use ^ after the hash
$ git show 5e37024660b27211f54c09121d152ac519baa0ce^
This shows the first ancestor. So you need ^^^^^^^^^ to show the 9th ancestor to that commit, for instance.

Going to their houses now

    9 Beaconside

    Yeah, of course I used the backdoor to the factory, that's the closest entrance to the freezer and I
    brought in some ingrediants that can't really stand the heat.

    At the time of the murder I was at a block party right down the street from here, we threw the party
    for one of the neighbors who got back from the hospital after an accident. I was with my kids. You
    can ask anyone who's been there.

    Oh wait, you know what? We took a picture... Let me get my phone.

    See? That's me, that's the neighbor, here's my little girl. And you see the timestamp?

    So yeah, I really don't have anything to do with that... Barely knew the victim...

    But you know what? I did see someone rushing out of the factory... He got into a green Hyundai, you
    don't see many of those around here... Probably a rental. I didn't catch his face, was just weird
    seeing someone running off like that... Come to think about it, maybe that person had something to
    do with it?

    Anyways, best of luck catching whoever did it!

    No one's home...

    You can take a look around though.

    73 Tamworth Drive

    No one's home...

    Maybe take a look around the perimeter?
-------------------------------------------

The last two contain a commit hash that can be seen if you git show the commit and view the contents.
Entering this hash into git show again reveals a message.

26 Balcombe Inspection 
-----------------------------------------
Nobody's home. From the stack of letters in the mailbox nobody's been here for a good few days.

Without a warrant you can't get into the house, but you can still checkout the area. Maybe talk with
some of the neighbors.

The guy next door says he barely ever spoke to the suspect, "was a bit of a loner" is what he says.
Doesn't know what type of vehicle he drives.

You take a stroll around the house, there's a back porch that probably seen better days. You spot a
driveway next to it leading to a garage. The door's open and you see a green Hyundai parked there.

73 Tamworth Inspection
------------------------------------------
There's no one answering the door. Obviously you won't break in because you don't have a warrant or
anything. But nothing's wrong with looking around the place...

You check around the house, there's no car. Not even a driveway. You do find a bike resting against
the fence. It's pretty close to the factory, so makes sense the suspect bikes to work.

Just to make sure, you ask some of the neighbors, they confirm that the suspect doesn't own a car.
One of them says he doesn't even have a license.

Another neighbor says he saw the suspect coming back from work on the day of the murder at about
5PM, they chatted for a bit before his sister picked him up to visit their parents. They live pretty
far away, so that places him away from Git Town at the time of the murder.
-------------------------------------------

I believe I've found our guy. Mr. Green Hyundai himself. Let's check our work.
echo "Cosmo Siwkonk" | git hash-object --stdin | grep -iq -f /dev/stdin <(git show solution) && echo 'You found the murderer!' || echo 'No cigar, chief... Try again.'

Sure enough, Cosmo Siwkonk.
